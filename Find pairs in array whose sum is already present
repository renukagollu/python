Use Hint
Given an array A of N distinct and positive elements, the task is to find number of unordered pairs whose sum already exists in given array.
Expected Complexity : n^2
SAMPLE INPUT
A : [ 3, 4, 2, 6 ,7]
SAMPLE OUTPUT
2
EXPLANATION
The pairs following the conditions are : 
(2,4) = 6,
(3,4) = 7

Solution:
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        res=set()
        c=0
        c1=0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            res.add(A[i])
        #print(res)
        for i in range(len(A)):
            for j in range(i+1,len(A)):
                c=A[i]+A[j]
                if(c in res):
                    c1=c1+1
        return c1
