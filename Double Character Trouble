Q3. Double Character Trouble

Problem Description
You have a string, denoted as A.

To transform the string, you should perform the following operation repeatedly:
Identify the first occurrence of consecutive identical pairs of characters within the string.
Remove this pair of identical characters from the string.
Repeat steps 1 and 2 until there are no more consecutive identical pairs of characters.
The final result will be the transformed string.

Input 1:
 A = "abccbc"

Output 1:"ac"

Solution:
class Solution:
    # @param A : string
    # @return a strings
    def solve(self, A):
        stack=[]
        a=''
        for i in A:
            if not stack:
                stack.append(i)
                #print(stack)
            else:
                if stack[-1]==i:
                    stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(i)
        if stack:
            a=''.join([ i for i in stack])
        return a
