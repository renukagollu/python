Q4. Nearest Smaller Element
Problem Description
Given an array A, find the nearest smaller element G[i] for every element A[i] in the array such that the element has an index smaller than i.

More formally,

G[i] for an element A[i] = an element A[j] such that

j is maximum possible AND

j < i AND

A[j] < A[i]

Elements for which no smaller element exist, consider the next smaller element as -1.

Input 1:
 A = [4, 5, 2, 10, 8]


Example Output
Output 1:[-1, 4, -1, 2, 2]

    # @param A : list of integers

        stack = []
        for i in range(0, len(A), 1): 
            # pop all the elements from the stack greater than current element
            while (stack != [] and stack[-1] >= A[i]):
                stack.pop()
            if stack == []:
                ans.append(-1)
            else:
                ans.append(stack[ - 1])
            stack.append(A[i])
        return ans
